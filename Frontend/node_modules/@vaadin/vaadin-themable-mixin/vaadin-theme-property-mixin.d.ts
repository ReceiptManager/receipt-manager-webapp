   * attribute value to the subcomponents in Shadow DOM by binding
   * the subcomponentâ€™s "theme" attribute to the `theme` property of
   * the host.
   *
   * **NOTE:** Extending the mixin only provides the property for binding,
   * and does not make the propagation alone.
   *
   * See [Theme Attribute and Subcomponents](https://github.com/vaadin/vaadin-themable-mixin/wiki/5.-Theme-Attribute-and-Subcomponents).
